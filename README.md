# Romanceable Rasmodia SVE - mod for Stardew Valley

Nexus mod site: https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/8265

What this mod brings to the game:
* The old Wizard is now a Witch - changes the name (Rasmodius to Rasmodia) and gender in the game files
* Changes dialogues to fit the new gender

Original romance mod was made by haywrite (dialogue expansion), WerewolfMaster (romance part) and PaintedParrot (adjustments to SVE mod)
Assets by CreepyKat with my edits to fit mod
